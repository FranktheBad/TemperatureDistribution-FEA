# TemperatureDistribution-FEA
This project makes use of the Finite Element Analysis method to estimate the distribution of temperature across a surface with different boundary condition setup. The results are validated against the analytical solutions of the problems. 
See detailed breakdown of problem and solution in FiniteElementAnalysis.pdf
